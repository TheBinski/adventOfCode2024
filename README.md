Advent of Code 2024

Each day has 2 puzzles. In order to unlock the second puzzle you have to complete the first one.

12/01 Puzzles:
 - #1: Pair up the smallest number in the left list with the smallest number in the right list, then the second-smallest left number with the second-smallest right number, and so on. Within each pair, figure out how far apart the two numbers are; you'll need to add up all of those distances. For example, if you pair up a 3 from the left list with a 7 from the right list, the distance apart is 4; if you pair up a 9 with a 3, the distance apart is 6.

 - #2: This time, you'll need to figure out exactly how often each number from the left list appears in the right list. Calculate a total similarity score by adding up each number in the left list after multiplying it by the number of times that number appears in the right list.

12/02 Puzzles:
  - #1: The unusual data (your puzzle input) consists of many reports, one report per line. Each report is a list of numbers called levels that are separated by spaces. Find the total amount of safe reports. A report only counts as safe if both of the following are true:
        -The levels are either all increasing or all decreasing.
        -Any two adjacent levels differ by at least one and at most three.
  
  - #2: Now, the same rules apply as before, except if removing a single level from an unsafe report would make it safe, the report instead counts as safe.
        Update your analysis by handling situations where the Problem Dampener can remove a single level from unsafe reports. How many reports are now safe?
